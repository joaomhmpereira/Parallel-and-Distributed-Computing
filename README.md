### `Parallel and Distributed Computing` ###

This repository contains work developed in the [Parallel and Distributed Computing](https://fenix.tecnico.ulisboa.pt/disciplinas/CPD2/2022-2023/2-semestre/pagina-inicial) masters course at IST.

More specifically, it contains three (one sequential and two parallel) implementations of the [Travelling Salesman Problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travelling_salesman_problem) using the [Branch and Bound](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Branch_and_bound) algorithm. 

Regarding the parallel implementations, one was done using [OpenMP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenMP) and the other using [MPI (Message Passing Interface)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Message_Passing_Interface).
